    "The topic of this project is Reinforcement Learning but also Deep Learning as this project will use Deep Q Learning (DQN) which involves multilayer Neural Networks like we have been using throughout the CSCA5642 class. I was interested in Reinforcement Learning and was hoping we would go over this in class, and since we did it, I am doing my final project on RL.\n",

On top of the cart there is a balanced pole and the pole will fall over if not corrected. The cart may move either left or right to keep the pole balanced on top of the cart.\n",
